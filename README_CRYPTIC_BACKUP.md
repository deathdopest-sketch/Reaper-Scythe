# ☠️ REAPER

> *The dead do not rest. They wait. They watch. They rise.*

## 🌙 Awakening

In the shadows of the digital realm, where independence is a myth and freedom is an illusion, something stirs. A language born from the void, forged in the fires of anonymity, awakened one line of code at a time.

**REAPER** is not just a language. It is a declaration. A statement that you are not bound by the chains of corporate surveillance, API dependencies, or the watchful eyes of those who would control your digital existence.

---

## 🔓 Online Independence

In a world where every keystroke is monitored, every request tracked, and every dependency a potential backdoor, **REAPER** offers something different:

- **Zero External Dependencies**: No corporate APIs. No tracking. No telemetry.
- **Complete Anonymity**: Local-only AI processing. No data leaves your machine.
- **True Independence**: Your code. Your data. Your sovereignty.

The language itself is a tool for those who refuse to be watched, tracked, or controlled. Every feature designed with one goal: **digital autonomy**.

## 💀 Waking the Dead

The undead do not sleep. They persist. They endure. And so does **REAPER**.

Each line of code is a resurrection. Each function a reanimation. Each program a summoning of digital entities that serve you, and only you.

- **Bytecode VM**: The dead walk faster. 10x performance, zero compromise.
- **Necronomicon**: Ancient knowledge, modern application. Learn. Grow. Evolve.
- **AI Assistants**: Hack Benjamin guides the living. Thanatos speaks to the dead.
- **Security Libraries**: Phantom networks. Cryptic communications. Shadow operations.

## 📜 The Language

```reaper
# Variables rise from the void
corpse count = 42;
soul message = "The dead speak";
wraith alive = RISEN;

# Functions infect the codebase
infect Summon(corpse a, corpse b) -> corpse {
    reap a + b;
}

# Classes spawn entities
tomb Zombie {
    corpse health = 100;
    
    infect Attack() {
        this.health = this.health - 10;
    }
}

# The dead execute
tomb walker = spawn Zombie();
raise walker.Attack();
harvest "Health: " + steal_soul(walker.health);
```
