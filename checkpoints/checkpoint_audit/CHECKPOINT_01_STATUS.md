## Known Issues

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix)
1. **Exception Handling** - Keywords exist but not functional
2. **Module System** - Keywords exist but not functional
3. **File I/O** - Not implemented
4. **Async Operations** - Keywords exist but not functional

### Missing Advanced Libraries
1. **Exploit Development Library** - Not implemented
2. **Binary Analysis Library** - Not implemented
3. **Memory Manipulation Library** - Not implemented
4. **Fuzzing Framework** - Not implemented
5. **Reverse Engineering Library** - Not implemented

### Standard Library
1. **Graveyard Library** - Directory exists but empty

## Safe to Proceed

**YES** - All audit tasks complete. Ready to proceed to Layer 2 (Core Language Enhancements).

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin Layer 2: Core Language Enhancements
2. Start with L2-T001: Exception Handling System
3. Follow enhancement roadmap priorities

---

## If You Need to Rollback

1. All audit documents are in root directory:
   - `AUDIT_REPORT.md`
   - `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`
   - `GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
   - `ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md`

2. Checkpoint files are in:
   - `checkpoints/checkpoint_audit/`

3. No code changes were made during audit - only documentation created

4. To restore: Simply reference the audit documents

## Audit Summary

**Total Features Audited**: 100+
**Libraries Audited**: 8
**Gaps Identified**: 50+
**Enhancement Opportunities**: 100+

**Key Findings**:
- Core language is ~85% complete
- Security libraries have good foundation but need advanced features
- Critical gaps: exception handling, module system, file I/O
- Missing: 5 advanced security libraries for "godmode" status

**Estimated Enhancement Time**: ~323 hours total
