# Reaper Standalone Hacking Language Transformation Plan

## Project Vision

Transform Reaper into a standalone compiled executable language focused on hacking, anonymity, and security operations. The language will maintain its unique zombie/death-themed core syntax while adding powerful security-focused libraries for network operations, cryptography, system manipulation, and web operations.

## Architecture Strategy

### Compilation Approach

- Use Nuitka or PyInstaller for Python-to-binary compilation
- Create optimized bytecode VM for better performance
- Bundle all dependencies into single executable
- Support cross-platform compilation (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### Library Organization

- **Core Language**: Keep zombie theme (corpse, soul, tomb, etc.)
- **Security Libraries**: Add themed security modules (phantom, specter, shadow, etc.)
- **Built-in Integration**: Seamless access to security features from Reaper code

## Layer 1: Security Libraries - Core Infrastructure

Build independent security modules as Python libraries that will be compiled into the final executable.

### Network Operations Module (`phantom` library)

- Port scanning (stealth, SYN, UDP, TCP)
- Packet crafting and manipulation (Scapy integration)
- DNS operations (queries, zone transfers, spoofing)
- Proxy/VPN integration (SOCKS, HTTP proxy support)
- Network sniffing and packet capture
- SSL/TLS operations and certificate manipulation

### Cryptography Module (`crypt` library)

- Encryption/decryption (AES, RSA, ChaCha20, Blowfish)
- Hashing algorithms (SHA family, MD5, bcrypt, scrypt)
- Key generation and management
- Steganography (hide data in images, audio, text)
- Digital signatures and verification
- Password cracking utilities

### System Operations Module (`wraith` library)

- File manipulation (secure delete, metadata modification)
- Process control and injection
- Memory inspection and manipulation
- Registry operations (Windows)
- Privilege escalation helpers
- Log manipulation and cleaning

### Web Operations Module (`specter` library)

- HTTP/HTTPS client with custom headers

## Success Criteria

1. Standalone executable compiles on Windows, Linux, macOS
2. All 5 security modules fully functional
3. Language maintains backward compatibility with existing Reaper code
4. Performance meets or exceeds targets
5. Comprehensive documentation complete
6. 20+ example security scripts working
7. Community adoption begins (GitHub stars, forum activity)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Compilation Issues**: Have fallback to Python bundle distribution
- **Legal Concerns**: Clear documentation, ethical guidelines, no malware
- **Performance Problems**: Optimize hot paths, consider Cython for critical modules
- **Platform Compatibility**: Extensive testing, CI/CD for all platforms
- **Feature Creep**: Strict scope management, MVP first approach
